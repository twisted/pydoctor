For the language syntax documentation, read the `ReST docutils syntax reference <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_.

Fields
------

See :ref:`fields section <codedoc-fields>`.

In addition to the standard set of fields, the reStructuredText
parser also supports **consolidated fields**, which combine the documentation
for several objects into a single field.

These consolidated fields may be written using either a `bulleted list <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#bullet-lists>`_
or a `definition list <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#definition-lists>`_.

- If a consolidated field is written as a bulleted list, then each list item must begin with the field's argument,
  marked as `interpreted text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#inline-markup>`_, and followed by a colon or dash.
- If a consolidated field is written as a definition list, then each definition item's term should contain the field's argument, (it is not mandatory for it being marked as interpreted text).

The following example shows the use of a definition list to define the ``Parameters`` consolidated field with type definition.
Note that *docutils* requires a space before and after the ``:`` used to mark classifiers.

.. code:: python

    def fox_speed(size, weight, age):
        """
        :Parameters:
            size
                The size of the fox (in meters)
            weight : float
                The weight of the fox (in stones)
            age : int
                The age of the fox (in years)
        """

Using a bulleted list.

.. code:: python

    def fox_speed(size:float, weight:float, age:int):
        """
        :Parameters:
            - `size`: The size of the fox (in meters)
            - `weight`: The weight of the fox (in stones)
            - `age`: The age of the fox (in years)
        """

The following consolidated fields are currently supported by PyDoctor:

.. table:: Consolidated Fields

    ==============================      ==============================
    Consolidated Field Tag              Corresponding Base Field Tag
    ==============================      ==============================
    ``:Parameters:``                    ``:param:``
    ``:Keywords:``                      ``:keyword:``
    ``:Exceptions:``                    ``:except:``
    ``:Variables:``                     ``:var:``
    ``:IVariables:``                    ``:ivar:``
    ``:CVariables:``                    ``:cvar:``
    ``:Types:``                         ``:type:``
    ==============================      ==============================

Fields are case *insensitive*.

Cross-references
----------------

PyDoctor replaces the Docutils' default `interpreted text role <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/roles.html>`_ with the creation of
`documentation cross-reference links <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/epydoc.html#documentation-crossreference-links>`_. If you want to create a cross-reference link
to the ``module.Example`` class, simply put backticks around it, typing::

    `module.Example`

.. note:: Sphinx interpreted text roles for code references like ``:obj:`` or ``:meth:`` are not required and will be ignored. 

Directives
----------

Here is a list of the supported ReST directives by package of origin:

- `docutils`: ``.. include::``, ``.. contents::``, ``.. image::``,
  ``.. figure::``, ``.. unicode::``, ``.. raw::``, ``.. math::``,
  ``.. role::``, ``.. table::``, ``.. code::``, ``.. warning::``, ``.. note::``
  and other admonitions, and a few others.
- `epydoc`: None yet.
- `Sphinx`: ``.. deprecated::``, ``.. versionchanged::``, ``.. versionadded::``, ``.. code-block::``
- `pydoctor`: ``.. python::``

Colorized snippets directive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using reStructuredText markup it is possible to specify Python snippets in a
`doctest block <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#doctest-blocks>`_.


If the Python prompt gets in your way when you try to copy and paste and you are not interested
in self-testing docstrings, the python directive will let you obtain a simple block of colorized text. 
Directives ``.. code::`` and ``.. code-block::`` acts exactly the same.

::

    .. python::

        def fib(n):
            """Print a Fibonacci series."""
            a, b = 0, 1
            while b < n:
                print b,
                a, b = b, a+b

.. note:: HTML element's classes generated by our custom ``HTMLTranslator`` have a ``"rst-"`` prefix

.. note:: In any case, *plaintext* docstring format will be used if docstrings can't be parsed with *restructuredtext* parser.
