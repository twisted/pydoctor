HTML Formatter:

  - show function signatures for functions in "children" tables
  - Do something more useful with Interface information
    - blue boxes for interface docstrings in implementation methods?
    - work out a sensible way to display deeper interface information.
  - Parameterise epydoc usage instead of just basing on presence of epydoc
  - Make Pretty

Model:

  - sanitize the model of tracking interface implementations wrt
    inheritance
  - think fairly hard about how robust the code is -- we should
    *never* crash out.
  - understand import * from a package
  - the package.contents vs package.contents['__init__'].contents
    thing is getting out of hand.
  - should probably aim for slightly smarter data model --
    .parentModule attributes, having the .kind of Function contained in
    a Class be "Method", that sort of thing.

General:

  - sort out a consistent verbosity story
